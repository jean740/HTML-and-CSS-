        <p>A clipper ship is a synonym for a merchant ship from the 19th century that plied global routes and ferried cargo and passengers.

            In the 1840s, a new kind of merchant navy vessel was created by American shipbuilders. It facilitated faster transport of cargo through the oceanic waters.</p>
